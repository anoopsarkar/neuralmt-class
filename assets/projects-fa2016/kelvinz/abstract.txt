Project: Using GRU for the Alignment Score
Student: Kelvin Cheng

In the equation by Bahdanau et al., the alignment score only takes
input of the previous target-side encoded vector and the source-side
vector.

However, the previous alignment scores might also be useful,
especially in a long sentence. Therefore, I propose to use a GRU
model for the alignment score, which can potentially capture more
complex ordering.
