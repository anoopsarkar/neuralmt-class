Title: Semi-supervised action localization in sports videos with temporal attention

how is the loss function computed? bounding box on test images are given?

is the frame network an LSTM or GRU? it was not clear what the "frame network" is supposed to be.

what happens if a frame has lots more players than other frames?

"9 frames are sampled" => not really sampling

no averages in the results for semi-sup from supervised
