Title: Semi-supervised action localization in sports videos with temporal attention

Abstract:
Instance level annotations are more useful than holistic level annotations
in many cases while requires extensive human labors. We propose a method
to transfer frame level event label to instance level action label with
few supervisions. To handle the noise and hard cases in the problem, we
introduce a temporal attention model with the intention to let the model
learn from the easy stereotype poses that are most distinguishable. This
does not only enables the model to localize obvious desired actions, but
also lays a good foundation for the model to understand more complicated
variations.
