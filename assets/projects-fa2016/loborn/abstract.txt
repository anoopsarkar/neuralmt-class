Semantic Role Labeling with a Neural Net Classifier

This project aims to train a neural net classifier to perform a
semantic role labeling task. Given a parsed sentence as input, the
system will simplify the parse tree using a set of simplification
rules, following Vickrey & Koller 2008 and Vickrey 2010. This will
produce a set of simple parse trees, which are passed as inputs to
an RNN encoder; these encodings are then combined (following the
method given in Zoph et al. 2016) and used to predict a class for
the set of inputs. Each output class corresponds to a possible role
labeling, so that correct classification corresponds to correctly
labeling the input.
