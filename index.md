## Neural Machine Translation <span class="text-muted">Fall 2016</span>

This is a special topics course entitled "Neural Machine Translation".
This is an advanced graduate seminar course is about recursive
neural network models for machine translation (for natural languages
such as English, Chinese, Tagalog, etc.). You will require some
background in statistical machine translation and language models.
This course will not be a tutorial on deep learning in general. The
main goal of the course will be to work on writing our own end to
end neural machine translation system. The course will cover recent
developments in neural machine translation and we hope to discuss
and solve issues with the long tail (limited vocabulary size in
neural MT) and in the proper modeling of alignment (aka attention).
