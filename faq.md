## (in) Frequently Asked Questions

### Email policy
    
* We will be using [the discussion board on courses.cs.sfu.ca](https://courses.cs.sfu.ca/) instead of email.
* Before starting a new topic please check if the topic is already under discussion and check to see if your question has already been answered.
* If you must email the instructor or TA directly then use your SFU email address to send the email (do not use any other provider), and use `cmpt882:` as the prefix in your subject line.
    
### Groups
    
* The project  will be done in groups. There is no maximum group size.
* You are allowed to leave a group and form a group of size one at the start of each homework but not at the end.
* __Effective group collaboration__: We are looking to see effective collaboration. People can play different roles and sometimes more than one role in the same project.
* Please include a `README.username` as part of your submission zip file for each `username` participating in the project.

### Using Git
    
* For effective group collaboration use a version control system. I recommend using `git`.
